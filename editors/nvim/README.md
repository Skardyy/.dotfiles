# Neovim

neovim config self made by me. aims to be minimal without losing functionality

### Plugins
* [UI](./lua/plugins/ui/): anything that adds more UI, e.g. fuzzy finders, statusline.
* [LSP](./lua/plugins/lsp/): anything related to Lsp / treesitter
* [Git](./lua/plugins/git/): anything related to git
* [Sugar](./lua/plugins/sugar/): things I can live without, but is nice to have

> its highly recommended to not depend on it and simply copy what you see fit.
