# Neovim

neovim config self made by me. aims to be minimal without losing functionality

### Main plugins
* [statusline](./lua/plugins/statusline.lua) uses heirline for lsp/TS tracking and other very simple file info
* [oil](./lua/plugins/oil.lua) oil is used as the file manager
* [telescope](./lua/plugins/telescope.lua) telescope is used as a fuzzy finder
* [completion](./lua/plugins/completions.lua) nvim-cmp as the completion engine
* [mason](./lua/plugins/mason.lua) mason is used to manage the installations of LSPs, diagnostic and formatters
* [And More!](./lua/plugins/) some are simply quality of life, others are a must like [lsp-config](./lua/plugins/lsp-config.lua)

> [!Note]  
>
> the config is **VERY** likely to change.  
> its highly recommended to not depend on it and simply copy what you see fit.
