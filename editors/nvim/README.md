# Neovim

Neovim config self made by me. Aims to be 'minimal' without losing functionality

### Plugins

- [UI](./lua/plugins/ui/): anything that adds more UI, e.g. fuzzy finders, statusline.
- [Core](./lua/plugins/core/): core editor functionality, e.g. lsp, treesitter, autocompletion.
- [Git](./lua/plugins/git/): anything related to git
- [Sugar](./lua/plugins/sugar/): things I can live without, but is nice to have

> its highly recommended to not depend on it and simply copy what you see fit.
