* make lualine better, (need to know ts and lsp)
* add l and h keybind to oil and neotree
* add lsp leader l d (line diagnostic)
* figure out why lua lsp sometimes doesn't work
* figure out why gitsigns does diff wrong (maybe crlf vs lf issue)
* figure out why lsp doesn't work in lua, (maye not work in other filetype)

* finally test it
